# PokemonTCGStats
WPF application to track Pokemon TCG match and player stats. 

**INTRO: This WPF desktop application was built using C#/.NET and utilizes SQL server to store player data on a local database. Utilizing Entity Framework, I can easily create new players/decks/matches and store the data inside the corresponding database.

This app was origianlly built to write player data to a JSON file, however, having to rewrite the whole file everytime I wanted to update a users data felt innefficent. I do have plans to upgrade the existing application and add additional features at a later date.
